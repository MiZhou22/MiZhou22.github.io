We first discuss the corresponding concepts about the digital twin model of battery management systems. Then, the state-of-charge (SoC) and state-of-health (SoH) estimation algorithms are presented in an integrated fashion for the monitoring and prognostics. Concretely, the extended Kalman filter algorithm (EKF) is used in this paper for the estimation of SoC, which improves the robustness of digital twin model, and the particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO) is used in this paper for the estimation of SoH.
